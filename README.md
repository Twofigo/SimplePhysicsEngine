I wrote this simple 2D convex rigid body physics engine because the algorithms were fascinating. It's been implemented entirely in pure JavaScript+ HTML+ CSS over two summers.

The maths are based on a series of wonderful articles by Chris Hecker from 1996, along with the calculation of rotational inertia of polygons taken from the point-mass inertia equation in a physics book I had.

When writing this project, I had not studied linear algebra; much credit goes to the 3b1b, an excellent YouTube series, for teaching me what I needed.
